Hello! I hope this one page website of my pet hamster will bring you 5 minutes of joy like it did with me. As it was created using the template from Bootstrap, its format is not the best and I don't think it reflects my coding ability fairly. It's still viewable, and the web page can be viewed by clicking on the link in the About box. The content of this repo will get updated as I continue to learn HTML and CSS with Bootstrap.
## Enjoy!
